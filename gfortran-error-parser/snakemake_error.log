Error in rule compile:
    jobid: 5
    output: nek5000
    shell:

        make -j nek5000 | tee -a build.log

        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
